## Description
- The motivation for this project was to create a note taker application for a small business owner, or anyone for that matter, myself included, to be able to write and save notes. I personally like to write notes and do so everyday so this application will be very useful. 
- The application uses an Express.js back end that saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.
